# ObjectDetectionUsingRPLidar
This repository contains the code for detection objects in the surrounding using RPLidar sensor. 

## Description
This repository contains the code for detectin objects in the surrounding using RPLidar sensor. Using this code one can calculate the distance of object from sensor and angle at which object is located. Further on one can calculate the breadth and width of the object present in the surrounding.
